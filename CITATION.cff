title: "RF Anomaly Detection Benchmark on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano"
abstract: >
  This repository contains the code and resources for benchmarking machine learning
  models for RF anomaly detection on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano platform. The study
  evaluates six ML architectures (AE, AAE, CNN-AE, LSTM-AE, ResNet-AE, FF) across
  multiple performance metrics including latency, throughput, energy efficiency,
  memory footprint, and resource utilization using both PyTorch and TensorRT optimization.
  *Code was produced with some assistance of Claude Sonnet 4 and Claude
  Sonnet 4.5 was used to assist with repository documentation.
